Week 36 - Data Structures: Sequences & comprehensions
=====================================================


Today we will work with data structures in python. You will by the end of these sessions be able to use Lists and Tuples, read and Write to Files and work with the for and while loop.

Learning goals
--------------

After this week you will be able to:
        
        - Work with lists, tuples
        - Loop over sequences with a for, foreach & while loops.  
        - Sort sequences using the build in sorted function and use its key function to perform custom sorting.  
        - Read from files using the build in "open" function.
